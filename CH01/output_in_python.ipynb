        "In the Dark Ages of computers - before *monitors* existed - we would use *printers* to see the output of a program. Can you believe that? What a waste of paper! Like, every time we wanted to see the results of running software we would have to send the output to a printer, wait for the printer to print, and then look at the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, the popular computer game **The Oregon Trail** (you know, \"You died of dysentery\" fame) was played this way! The classroom had a *teletype* machine (kind of like a typewriter that was hooked up to a computer). You could type in input and the input would go to a computer in a closet somewhere and send the results back to the teletype. You can [read about the history of **The Oregon Trail** here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90702587/oregon-trail-computer-game-50th-anniversary). It's bonkers. In fact, the computer game predates the paper version of Dungeons and Dragons!\n",
        "\n",
        "Anyhow, the reason this is important is that you need to understand that in computer programming languages the term `print` still lingers. It's evolved over the years to mean \"print the output on the computer monitor instead of print on an actual printer\". So when you see the term `print` in most languages, it really means that the results will be displayed on the screen."
