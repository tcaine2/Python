Yes, that is a bit of a broad definition, but really that's what it boils down to. Programs almost always include *input* (information from the user), *logic* (some sort of decision making), and *output* (the result of using logic on the input - usually the output is displayed on the screen).\n","\n","Input might not necessarily come from a *user* (a person). Input might be from any source. For example, some programs (like smart lights on the exterior of a house) rely on time of day. Some programs might use a sensor (some traffic intersections might be controlled by a magnetometer under the asphalt, a timer, or a camera that senses the number of cars). Some programs (like windshield wipers that turn on when it starts to rain) rely on infrared moisture detectors.\n","\n","Programs can get fairly complicated - the logic might be very complex. A computer game like Tic-Tac-Toe can follow a fairly simple logic protocol to be competitive. There's a famous computer game called \"Nim\" that uses an even simpler *algorithm* (or step-by-step instructions) to ensure victory. You can imagine that other games like Chess or Go need extremely complex algorithms to function well. We'll take a look at logic and programming later on in this course.\n","\n","For right now, it's important to know that as you start your Python journey, you'll celebrate victories like getting your own program to run. After a few chapters, you'll celebrate learning new concepts like *if statements* and *loops*. Towards the end of the class, you'll still be kept on your toes as we look at *lists* (a way to store lots of data).\n","\n","## Program Design\n","\n","But there's something you should keep in mind - there is a big difference between *programming* (often referred to as *coding*) and *program design*. When we first get started, we'll be programming. We'll be using very foundational concepts to write programs to do very simple tasks - and we won't care about efficiency or style. But as our understanding matures, we'll up the ante. We'll want to be more intentional about how we design our programs. We'll want to be creative and not just \"accomplish the task\". Being a successful programmer means having a solid understanding of the tools of Python and also a view to making the program succinct and clear.\n","\n","Think of good program design as the analog of writing. A story that doesn't have great structure, is redundant, and doesn't easily convey the message is okay. It gets the job done. At first, our programs will be like this story. Our programs will get the job done, but there's nothing magical about the code. Later on, once we become comfortable with the tools, we can pay more attention to the craft of the program. We can streamline our code, avoid redundancies, use fancy footwork to make our code more elegant. That's the dream. So as we go through the course, constantly strive to search for ways to make your code more impressive.\n","\n","## Failure is good!\n","\n","The other thing you really need to understand is that failure is important. It is a magical tool. Failure gives us telemetry. It gives us data. It gives us insight into what we're doing wrong - which will inform our next iteration. Ask any *software engineer* (a programmer that is a virtuoso with code) how many mistakes they make daily and they will most likely admit that they make a ton of mistakes.\n","\n","And that's fine.\n","\n","**You need to get comfortable with failure!** And programming is one of the best places to do that! It's such low stakes. And because we use software that automatically tests our code, you'll be the only one who knows your failures. Let's call those \"micro-failures\". That gives us space to practice, to telescope, to probe, and to try new things. It allows us to evaluate what worked and what didn't work and let us improve. Here's what that looks like:\n","\n","* We submit a program to our autograder\n","* The program fails\n","* We look at the feedback and correct what we think the issue is\n","* We submit the program again\n","* The program fails\n","* We look at the feedback and realize we fixed one thing, but there is still another issue\n","* We fix that second issue\n","* We submit the program again\n","* The program still fails\n","* Looking at the feedback, it looks like when we fixed the second problem we broke something else\n","* We identify what we did wrong\n","* We fix what we did wrong\n","* We resubmit\n","* The program passes!\n","\n","This is called *iteration*. It's a state of mind. It's admitting that things just ain't always going to work and we can learn from our mistakes. It's essential in programming. And if you master the art of failing as a tool in programming, you might want to translate that to other areas of your life. Learning from your mistakes and looking for ways to improve is a great tool for life in general. A few things to note about this vignette about failure:\n","\n","1. All software development companies write test cases for their code and they can run their code against the tests to see if the program is behaving properly\n","\n","2. In our case, we can use our autograder as much as we want; we can test our programs dozens of times to see if the code passes\n","\n","3. If the code doesn't pass, we can usually infer from the error message (or the output) what went wrong\n","\n","## IDE\n","\n","To program, you'll need an *integrated development environment (IDE)*. This is software that lets you create and edit your code, run your code, and *debug* your code (help you find errors). There are a number of IDEs out there you can use for Python (Visual Studio Code and PyCharm are two of the best, but there are lots of other ones). In addition to an IDE, if you intend to use Python on your computer you'll need to install other software that can understand your Python program and let it run - and if you're new to programming that can get frustrating.\n","\n","The easiest way to circumvent installing software and troubleshooting is to use a cloud-based IDE. Because it's in the cloud, all the installations are taken care of for you and you'll always have the latest and greatest versions running. Note that for this class you are not required to use any specific IDE, but I recommend a cloud-based one (right now, Google Cloud Shell and GitHub Codespaces are the two best ones).\n","\n","A Python program is really just a text file with a different extension. Instead of an `.txt` file extension, Python files are `.py`. The file extension helps the IDE format the document properly with colors and indents. But you can open Python files with most text editors.\n","\n","## Comments\n","\n","Most programming languages permit the use of *comments*. A comment is text in the code that is not executed. There are a few reasons why we use comments:\n","\n","1. **We want to describe what a section of code does.** Hopefully the code you write is self-explanatory. But occasionally we might have code that might not be clear to someone else. In these cases, we can use comments. We might write a few sentences explaining what is going on in the complex code segment.\n","\n","2. **We want to omit code.** Sometimes we might not need some code we've written to run, but we don't want to delete it. There are a number of times when this might be helpful. Maybe the software has three distinct phases, and we've finished the first phase and we're working on the second phase. As we're testing the code, we don't need to test the first phase every time we run the program. So we can \"comment it out\" so that the computer doesn't execute that code. When we are ready to publish the program, we can uncomment that first section.\n","\n","3. **We want to put extraneous information in our code.** This might include our name, date, and a description of the program. It might include the license you chose to license your code with. It might include - like in this course - some reflection questions.\n","\n","## Keywords\n","\n","You'll find out pretty quickly when you learn to program that you get to come up with your own names for objects in your program. For instance, if a program asks the user for their first name then you might store it in a variable called `name`. Or you might choose `first_name`. A particularly bad name to choose would be something like `x` as it does not indicate what type of data will be stored in it. Although it is legal in Python, it's not a good idea. We'll look at the constraints and conventions of variable names later on, but for right now it's important to know that you get creative freedom.\n","\n","However, there is also a list of words in Python that are known as `reserved words` or `keywords`. These are the pre-existing building blocks in Python. These are the commands you can use. The tools you get to create with. There are around thirty of them (listed below). Because they are baked into Python, you can't use any of these words as a variable name. These words have a specific meaning already. If you look at the list, you can probably guess what some of these words do. Note that the reserved words in bold are the ones we will be using in this course:\n","\n","```\n","and\n","as\n","assert\n","break\n","class\n","continue\n","def\n","del\n","elif\n","else\n","except\n","finally\n","for\n","from\n","global\n","if\n","import\n","in\n","is\n","lambda\n","None\n","nonlocal\n","not\n","or\n","pass\n","raise\n","return\n","try\n","while\n","with\n","yield\n","FALSE\n","TRUE\n","```\n","## Modules\n","\n","This won't be important immediately, but you should know about the idea of modules. A module is Python code that can be used by your program. Some modules, like `math`, are baked into Python. The `math` module has complex functions built-in. Things like square root (`sqrt()`) and PI (`math.pi`) live in this module. If you import it into your own code, you can use those functions (more on that later).\n","\n","Alternatively, you can make your own modules and use them in other programs. Don't worry - we'll be using that feature in the future.\n","\n","## Running a Python Program\n","\n","The last thing we need to cover right now is how to run a Python program. Once you finish writing your Python program (oftentimes, I run my program before it's done - I like to test it often as I build it), you can run the program from the `command line` (also called the `terminal`). I know this might be a bit abstract right now, but you don't need to remember this - we'll go over it again. But just to set the table for the first program, when you are in the terminal you just have to type `python3 <filename>` where **<filename>** is the name of your program. So let's say that we have a file named `my_first_program.py` and it lives in the directory (folder) called `programs`. To execute the program you'd make sure you are in the proper directory and then you'd write:\n","\n","<center>\n","\n","`python3 my_first_program`\n","\n","</center>\n","\n","That's it! The program will run!\n","Alternatively, many IDEs will give you a \"play\" button. Just hit the play button and the file will run.\n","\n","Even though this is a Jupyter notebook and not a Python program, you can still run code in it! If you hover over the section below you'll see a little play button. Click it! You might be asked to install some software. If you are, click YES. This is a one time thing 😃. Once you hit play, the output will be displayed underneath. There is a quick video below to show you how this works.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wPnaGJ2uelTa"},"outputs":[],"source":["# This is a simple program to output the words \"Hello World.\"\n","print('Hello world')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iMkadNy_elTb"},"source":["<center>\n","<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1csNPOXoG74?si=WRxEfdtdPn-__ANy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen style=\"border-radius: 15px !important;\"></iframe>\n","</center>"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.12"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
