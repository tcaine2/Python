# NAME: Thomas Caine
# DATE: 11/4/24
# BRIEF DESCRIPTION: This lab will explore file writing capabilities with Python. 
# In this lab, there are three different files on the server - pokemon.txt, 
# marvel.txt, and movies.txt



# 1. Make sure you fill out the comments above
# 2. Write your code in the proper spot
# 3. Be sure to answer the Reflection Questions and Attestation below
# 4. The Sample Output has been included in this code for your convenience

    This function will ask the user to type the name
    of a file. The program will open the file, ask the
    user to enter a word (or phrase), and add that input
    to the end of the file. 

    Then the file is closed.

    The file is reopened and the contents are output.

#          REFLECTION QUESTIONS
########################################

'''

1. Writing to a file isn't terribly hard if you can open a file. But how would you 
   take the contents of a file like the ones in the Sample Output and alphabetize them?
   Make sure you are specific - write down each step.

Please gauge your utilization of AI on the following spectrum. Place an "X" in front
of the appropriate response. Only choose one of the following:

[ ] I did not use AI at all for this lab.
[ ] I wrote the initial draft of the software but had AI help me make it better.
[ ] I fed the lab description to AI and had it generate a response but I modified it.
[ ] AI created the entire program for me.



It is critical in this class that you understand the concepts as we explore them because
those concepts are required understanding for entry level programming. Reliance on resources
like AI and internet sites like Chegg, CourseHero, StackOverflow, and general Google results
may impede your understanding. Please rate how well you understand the concepts in this lab: 

[ ] I understand very little about this lab.
[ ] I am about 50/50 on this lab; I get parts of it but not the whole picture.
[ ] I pretty much get it.
[ ] I'm solid. Totally got it.
