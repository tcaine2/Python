1. What is a lesson you learned during this lab? You do not have to restrict
   your response to Python. It might be a lesson in time management, a lesson
   using CodeGrade, or something else.

For completing this lab I learned that I can use my classmates to help me complete the work by working with
eachother to get the right output for the code
