We had to *import* the module and then we had unfettered access to the functions. While it is true that there are a ton of modules already floating around for you to use, there are times when you might want to make your own modules to use in multiple programs:\n","* A `calculator` module that has four basic functions can be imported into a program called `sci_calc` (a scientific calculator) and also `graph_calc` (a graphing calculator). Sure, you'd need to supplement both of those programs with more functions, but at least the basic four functions would be the same!\n","\n","* A `dice` module would be slick if you worked at a company that made games - you could import it into any program that needed dice rolls.\n","\n","* A `graph` module that can take in data and make different types of graphs can be used in a number of analytic software.\n","\n","Before we get started, let's agree on a convention. For the scope of this conversation, let's agree that our helper modules that we import will be called `something_util.py`. For instance, if we have a game called **Monopoly** that , our main program would be called `monopoly.py` and a helper module might be called `dice_util.py`. Or if the main program is a dashboard for an analytics company, the main program might be called `dashboard.py` and the module that is capable of making all the graphs and charts might be called `visualization_util.py`. I know this isn't super fancy, but it will help us as we talk about different cases - anything with `_util.py` will be the module with functions used in the main program.\n","\n","Note that some programs might use more than one module - that's really common. So in our previous example, we might have a main program called `dashboard.py` and it needs one module to make graphs, `graph_util.py` and another module to make charts, `chart_util.py`.\n","\n","<center>\n","<img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTCcO2SjWf6dRTnbu_WKclyxwAGcK4-tg-_OonXNj8vfCEbC6GjGURRkI6Wvm2m3d6ZUEzClwaSHdn_/pub?w=1329&amp;h=1474\" alt=\"A main program, dashboard.py, is invoking two different modules - graph_util.py and chart_util.py\" title=\"A main program, dashboard.py, is invoking two different modules - graph_util.py and chart_util.py\" width=\"500\" />\n","</center>\n","\n","More often than not, some support modules might provide help for several different programs. For instance, `monopoly.py`, `yahtzee.py`, and `trouble.py` all might need dice rolls and would each implement `dice_util.py`.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSsMHlEGrCHR1eyHk4HuKuo7Rm38sUaJH0FdajBm1vzzteoKwp8ZYkuJQ8vKpn7YMbXlDs3uQX5nJbr/pub?w=1329&amp;h=1474\" alt=\"Three icons of files; each file has some functions as well as a line call to invoke one of the functions.

That's just a Dave thing. I do it for clarity and so we don't have to keep track of which modules are helper modules.\n","\n","## EXAMPLE: `dice_util.py` and `dice_game.py`\n","\n","In this framework, we'll have a file called `dice_util.py` that has code to:\n","\n","* `roll_one_die()` - will return a number between 1 and 6, inclusive\n","\n","* `roll_two_die()` - will return a number between 2 and 12, inclusive\n","\n","* `roll_n_sided_die(sides)` - if you *pass in* the number of `sides`, it will return a number between 1 and `sides`\n","\n","* `roll_n_sided_dice(sides, dice)` - you pass in **two** numbers - `sides` and the number of dice (`dice`) and this returns the total of all the rolls\n","\n","Here is the code for this *module*.

The actual file, `dice_util.py`, should reside in the same directory as this Jupyter Notebook to run; changing the code below will not alter results in this Notebook.

It's okay if you don't understand, for instance, how `roll_n_sided_dice()` works as long as you know that if you give it the number of sides on a dice and the number of dice, it will roll those dice, add up all the values, and then return the total.\n","\n","In fact, one of the benefits of using modules is that you **don't need to know how the code works**. That's the beauty! You just have to know **how to use the functions** (for instance, some of the functions in `dice_util.py` don't require any input and some of them do). Now that we think about it, I suspect when we were looking at the `random` module you never investigated how the functions worked - you just needed to know the specifics (like calling `random.randint(1, 6)` is different than `random.randrange(1, 7)`).\n","\n","Enough yammering.
