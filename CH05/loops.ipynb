A \"loop\" will execute the same code over and over and over - until a condition is met. In any loop, each time the code repeats is called an *iteration*. There are a few different kinds of loops in Python:\n","\n","* A program will *iterate* through a list of items.\n","\n","* A program will provide a countdown.\n","\n","* A game will keep repeating until the user elects to quit.\n","\n","In the first two examples above, you could look at the code and determine how many times the loop will iterate. But in the last example, you could look at the code and you would **not** know how many times the loop will run - it's up to the user. The program might run once (if the user gets bored and doesn't want to play again) or it might run 100 times (if the user really enjoys the game).\n","\n","## `for` Loop to Iterate Through a `list`\n","\n","Let's look at some code for a program that iterates through a list of items.  I know we haven't really looked at the idea of a `list` yet, but that's okay - all you need to know for now is that a list is a bunch of items (like a grocery list!). They look like this:\n","\n","```python\n","grocery_list = ['bananas', 'cucumbers', 'milk', 'Reese\\'s']\n","```\n","\n","Yup! That's it! That's all a list is. We'll examine lists a bit more in a future chapter, but for now all you need to understand is that one variable - in this case, `grocery_list` - can hold multiple values.\n","\n","Now it's time to add a loop to it. One of the most popular types of loops is a `for` loop. In the biz, we might say something like \"I'm using a `for` loop to look at each item in the list\". The key word here is **in**. Python people have co-opted that word **in** for their loops. So we could say that we want to look at each individual item **in** `grocery_list`.\n","\n","We'll need **one** variable to hold each of the things in the list. Since the list is called `grocery_list`, perhaps a good name for the variable that will be referencing each individual item might be `grocery`? Or maybe `item`? I guess we'll go with `item`. Normally I would go with `grocery` but I think that the code might be confusing if we have one variable called `grocery` and another called `grocery_list`. I don't want anyone out there thinking that the two variables have to share part of a name. So `item` it is!"],"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rsY1kHL7a6ES"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hmKKceUha6EV"},"outputs":[],"source":["grocery_list = ['bananas', 'cucumbers', 'milk', 'Reese\\'s']\n","\n","print('GROCERY LIST')\n","print('============')\n","print()\n","\n","for item in grocery_list:\n","    print(item)\n","\n","print()\n","print('============')"]},{"source":["Let's go over a few things:\n","\n","1.

We follow it by the variable name that will temporarily hold the value of each individual item in the list. In this case, we used `item` although I think `grocery` is just as good.\n","\n","3. We use the word **`in`** to indicate that a list (or range!) is coming.\n","\n","4. We used `grocery_list` as the list\n","\n","5.
